# algorithms_resolved_codewar
Documented solutions to my algorithmic challenges on Codewars. Focus on JavaScript logic, clean code, and continuous learning.

# Codewars Challenges Archive

![Codewars Badge] https://www.codewars.com/users/nPerryKeanou/badges/large

## Overview
This repository is my algorithmic logbook. I archive my solutions to challenges on the **Codewars** platform here. 

The goal is threefold:
1. **Practice** JavaScript (and later TypeScript) daily.
2. **Document** my progress and how I solve complex problems.
3. **Learn** from the community's solutions after each validation.

## Repository organization
Each challenge is classified by difficulty level (**Kyu**):

* **8 Kyu**: Programming fundamentals, data types, simple loops.
* **7 Kyu**: Slightly more advanced logic, array and object manipulation.
* *Coming soon... (6 Kyu and beyond!)*

Each file contains:
- The link to the original statement.
- A quick explanation of my approach in the comments.
- My source code.
- Tests to verify the solution.

## How I work
Once I've successfully completed a Kata, I take the time to look at the community's “Best Practices.” If a solution is more elegant than mine, I analyze it and note my observations in the corresponding file.

## Statistics
- **Main language**: JavaScript
